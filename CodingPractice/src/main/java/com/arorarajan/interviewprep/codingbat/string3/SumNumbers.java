/**
 * Problem Statement: http://codingbat.com/prob/p121193 Given a string, return the sum of the
 * numbers appearing in the string, ignoring all other characters. A number is a series of 1 or more
 * digit chars in a row.
 * 
 * sumOfNumbers("abc123xyz") -> 123
 *
 * Hints: 
 * Character.isDigit(char) tests if a char is one of the chars '0', * '1', .. '9'.
 * Integer.parseInt(string) converts a string to an int.
